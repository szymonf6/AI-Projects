# Emotion Prediction from Tweets

This project uses a Simple LSTM model implemented in PyTorch to classify emotions from a dataset of tweets.

## Features
- Preprocessing of tweets (removal of usernames, links, punctuation).
- Tokenization and padding of sequences.
- Training and testing of an LSTM-based model for emotion prediction.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for required Python libraries.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
